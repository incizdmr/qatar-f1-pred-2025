# F1 Qatar 2025 GP Prediction — Performance Modeling Using Weighted Z-Scores

This project predicts driver performance for the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix using a custom weighted performance index based on z-score. It combines historical performance features (qualifying, race pace, sprint results, Qatar-track performance) into a single normalized score that ranks drivers and visualizes competitive insights.

## Main Insights

Top drivers score well across multiple categories, not just one metric.

Performance gaps between teammates highlight team balance and driver consistency.

Qatar-specific historical pace plays a measurable role in predicted results.
